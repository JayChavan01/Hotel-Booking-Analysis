### **Key Features & Functionalities:**  

1. **Data Processing & Cleaning:**  
   - Imported and cleaned the hotel booking dataset using Python.  
   - Handled missing values, duplicate records, and incorrect data entries.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identified booking trends across different hotel types.  
   - Analyzed seasonal variations in bookings.  
   - Examined cancellation patterns and their impact on revenue.  

3. **Key Insights & Metrics:**  
   - Total number of bookings and cancellations.  
   - Popular months for hotel bookings.  
   - Average length of stay for different customer types.  
   - Revenue insights based on room types and market segments.  

4. **Visualizations:**  
   - **Reservation Status:** Overview of confirmed and canceled reservations.  
   - **Reservation Status in Different Hotels:** Comparison between city and resort hotels.  
   - **Average Daily Rate (ADR) in City and Resort Hotels:** Pricing trends in different hotel types.  
   - **Reservation Status per Month:** Monthly breakdown of confirmed and canceled bookings.  
   - **ADR per Month:** Monthly revenue trends.  
   - **Top 10 Countries with Reservation Cancellations:** Identifying regions with the highest cancellation rates.  
   - **Average Daily Rate Over Time:** Tracking ADR fluctuations across the dataset period.
